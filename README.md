# FIFA22-analysis
### The aim of the project is to run a simple linear regression using the Ordinary Least Squares Method in Python. The following steps have been done:
- Importing the database from the Kaggle website and selecting the necessary data together with cleaning and processing data to make it appropriate for regression using NumPy and Pandas.
- Descriptive statistics and preliminary data analysis using the packages seaborn and myplotlib
- Running the regression, analysing the results and diagnosing the model using the statsmodels.
